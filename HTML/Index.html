            <h1> My Story </h1>
            <p>Im majed alswaeer, it all started on 30-12-1998 when i was born and now i have spented 23 years of my
                life, it pretty nice al hamdullah, i grew up in naur till the second grade then i moved to marj
                alhammam, my passion in mechanical engineering started when i recived my first gift from my school, i
                decerved this gift because i got the highest rank over all the student in the same grade, since that
                time i decided to be a mechanical engineer. In my high school level i decided to to the industrial
                tawjehi because i can reach my goal easily with more practical experiance so i made it, i made it with
                highest rank all over the high school al hamdullah. then the great journey began in the german jordanian
                university where i studied 4 years then i want to germany where i studied one semester and worked on
                semester as well. finally i graduated with a bechlor's of science in mechanical engineering. after that
                i knew that i have to take something to make me special from the other mechanical engineers specially in
                jordan where there is no opportunities for normal pepole unfortunately, as a result, i got this great
                opportunity which is a scholarship in ASAC to study software development, softwares and coding are the
                future for the current and next technologie, so <b>THATS MY CHANCE</b> </p>
